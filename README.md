# My-Journey

## Purpose

This is my portfolio where I will build on as I progress in the Bootcamp. I included a short decription about myself and below that are the current projects I've worked on. Even further down is a section of different platforms a individual can get in contact with me. This project, at first, was challenging becuase I would have to build my code from scratch and make sure I was also establish branches and subbranches (feature). However, my previous projects acted as a guide to how I wanted my portfolio to appear and function.

After laying out my index.html into 4 sections (the header, about me, my projects, contact me) and applying hidden comments to make it easier for others to see how I organized my page; I worked on making my links in the navigation section scroll to their corresponding section. As shown in my first screenshot I made sure my Id attribute had the same name as my herf attribute.

The difficult part of my projects was making my projects section. One challenge was trying to add the text inside of the img of the current projects. I had failed to do that and resulted in just writing a short description of what I've learned while doing such project. What I do like about my peojects section is that when you hover over it it does get larger and when you click on it; it does sent the viewer to the deployed application. The second and third screenshot shows how I was able to link the img of the projects to my web applications and the style.css shows how I made the img size bigger when hovered.

Another part of the portfolio that took some time was applying the media querys. I wanted to make sure my web apllication was mobile friendly and can be viewed on most screen sizes. what helped was using flexbox and added classes mainly in my project section to when the size of the screen is smaller it would my project cards would start in new column. I also applied flexbox to the header section and the about me section too. In my fourth screenshot I what I did to my style.css to mkae my website fit on a screen size at a max-width of 989px.

The more exciting part of my project was the aesthetisc. I add fun added rounded corners, shadows, and the hover feature when you hover over my navigation links. Overall, I'm proud of what I've done so far considering how long I've been in the BootCamp and I know I can still work on improving my portfolio.
